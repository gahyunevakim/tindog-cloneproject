TinDog clone project

I tried this project few months ago.
At that time, it was really difficult to understand and made it.
I almost quit learning.
I decided to do over this project and quite successed.
Some part still difficult, so still need some original code.
but even that part need to change and add more code that I creat my own.
Because first time that I started, I didn't find out original code.
Some part is pretty different with origin's.
I'm so proud myself! I did it again! Yeah!


I used HTML, CSS and bootstarp.

*Difficulties*

1. Z-index
This is not easy to use. But now I can tell them apart quietly.

2. carousel
Using carousel is pretty easy but control spacing is hard going.

3. margin and padding
It is confusing margin and padding.
I know the differences between them, but I don't know when to use.
This project I think I used padding a lot than margin.

4. media
Set the media is difficult.
Everything is not moved right way that I wanted.
I need a lot of practice about media.
